# PDQ-Deploy-Nessus
Custom PDQ Packages for common Nessus mitigations I have come across over the years. Includes Powershell scripts, registry keys, etc. The commands and scripts from these packages can be extracted to be used manually or integrated with Active Directory, remote PowerShell, DSC, or other management tools.
